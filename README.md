# Percona Software Repositories Documentation

Percona provides `apt` and `yum` package repositories of our
[software](https://www.percona.com/software/) for all supported Linux
distributions.

Located at [https://repo.percona.com/](https://repo.percona.com/), these contain
binary and source packages of the latest official product releases as well as
dedicated repositories for testing and experimental builds.

The `percona-release` tool can be used to simplify the process of subscribing to
these repositories.

This git repository contains the MarkDown source code used to build the [Percona
Software Repositories Documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-software-repositories/)
which describes the `percona-release` tool and the available repositories that
provide installable packages of [Percona Software](https://www.percona.com/software).
